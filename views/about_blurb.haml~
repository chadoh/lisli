  Lisa enjoys mixing genres, languages, high and low culture, and urban and rural settings. After graduating from Penn State with degrees in English and Spanish, she spent a brief stint as a copy editor at a small-town newspaper, then left for a job that offered health insurance and paid more than a pittance. Now, she tries to distract herself from her day job (that has nothing to do with her degrees) by reading, writing, finding freelance projects, sewing, and playing music with the Roaring Kittens (http://www.myspace.com/theroaringkittens).
